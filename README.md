# HearthRoulette

This addon creates a "HearthRoulette" macro which will use a random
hearthstone-equivalent toy, a hearthstone-equivalent spell (e.g. Astral Recall)
or a hearthstone, if it exists in the player's inventory. If any of the player's
hearthstone toys are marked as favorites, the random selection will be made only
from those toys.
